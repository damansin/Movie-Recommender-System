# Movie-Recommender-System

* Created a content-based recommendation system built using Python, Streamlit, pandas, and scikit-learn. It provides personalized movie suggestions based on user-selected titles. <br>
* The system preprocesses movie data and uses a similarity matrix to identify and rank the top five similar movies. The user interface, powered by Streamlit, offers a seamless experience by allowing movie selection and displaying recommendations with corresponding posters fetched from The Movie Database (TMDb) API. <br>
* This project demonstrates effective data handling, vectorization, and machine learning integration to deliver accurate and visually appealing movie recommendations.
